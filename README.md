# shut-the-box

Playing around with the game Shut the Box.

I play this game with my kids. It is a good game to pratice adding small numbers and partitioning small numbers into sums.
There is some logic and strategy involved but I have realized the game is simple enough that you can enumerate the entire game state graph very easily.
Plotting the graph is a mess, but it is possible.

Questions:
* What does the game state graph look like?
* What is expected score?
* Can you determine an optimal strategy computationally?
* How do strategies and changes of rules play out?
