# shut-the-box

Playing around with the game Shut the Box.

I play this game with my kids. It is a good game to pratice adding small numbers and partitioning small numbers into sums.
There is some logic and strategy involved but I have realized the game is simple enough that you can enumerate the entire game state graph very easily.
Plotting the graph is a mess, but it is possible.

## Questions:
* What does the game state graph look like?
* What is expected score?
* Can you determine an optimal strategy computationally?
* How do strategies and changes of rules play out?

## Rules
* [Rules at masterofgames.com](https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/shut-box-rules.htm)
* [Rules on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_Box)

We play with a [nice 4-person set](https://www.amazon.com/WE-Games-4-Player-Shut-Box/dp/B008LUJ02A).
Don't forget to use the flipping numbers to launch dice into the air. That is also good times.
